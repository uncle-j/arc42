== Building Block View

The building block view in this documentation is based on Simon Browns C4-Model and covers the views on:

* Context-level
* Container-level
* Component-level

Not covered is the code-level

=== Level 1 - Context Diagram

[plantuml]

!include ../c4-model/Context-Diagram.puml
----


Motivation::
* The system is a standalone system which does not require any external systems

Contained Building Blocks::
* Gym Management System

=== Level 2 - Container Diagram

==== White Box <Gym Management System>

[plantuml]
.Container Diagram of the Gym Management System
----
!include ../c4-model/Container-Diagram.puml
----

Motivation::
* a deployment monolith was chosen instead of microservices because of:
** low load on the system due to limited number of users
** reduced development complexity
** reduced deployment complexity

Contained Blackboxes::

.Containers of the Gym Management System.

[plantuml]
.Component Diagram of the Server Application of the Gym Management System
