= 003 - Implement Bounded Contexts using jMolecules on Package-level

== Status: Accepted

== Context

The structure of the Gym Management System is heavily based on the functional decomposition.

Following the functional decomposition is required to keep maintenance and extension efforts low,
have clarity about the location of the implementation, and, in case the application grows, allow for easier split of development teams.

== Decision

Bounded Contexts need to be implemented as Java-packages inside the main-package `com.buschmais.gymmanagement`.

Each of these packages needs to be annotated with `o.j.d.a.BoundedContext` via a `package-info.java`.
The annotation must specify the name of the bounded context completely, e.g. "UserContext".

== Consequences

Implementation of features requires to follow the dependency directions as documented in section 3 of the ADR.
